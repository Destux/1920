	<h1>Yo!</h1>
	<h2 class="highlight">I'm Sudhanshu a.k.a. Destux</h2>
	<h3 class="highlight">And this is the announcement of Project 1920 </h3>
	<p>So, I've been thinking about doing something like this for a total of 3 hours now. So here I am, announcing this without any clue, just making details up as I go on writing this.</p>
	<h3 class="highlight">"What even is this?"</h3>
	<p>So I wanted to get deep into web animations with JS libs, but I couldn't do it since I am lazy. So I started this project taking inspiration from a million people who celebrate Octobers with 30 days of code. But I'm still not as experienced to put out stuff at that rate, so what I'm doing is I'm taking this date, Oct-5-2021 as a start and from today, I will be working with a new lib every month for 12 months.</p>
	<h3 class="highlight">The planned libraries</h3>
	<p>The libs I will be doing include:
		<ul type="circle">
			<li>p5.jsðŸ’˜</li>
			<li>p5-sound.jsðŸ’•</li>
			<li>three.jsðŸ˜–</li>
			<li>anime.jsðŸ˜Œ</li>
		</ul>
		The libs I haven't gone through but look good on the surface include:
		<ul type="circle">
			<li>mo.js</li>
			<li>howler.js</li>
			<li>GreenSock.js</li>
			<li>Velocity.js</li>
			<li>Popmotion.js(X-doubt)</li>
			<li>lax.js</li>
			<li>Ani.js (Unique af)</li>
			<li>Vivus.js</li>
			<li>ScrollReveal.js</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3 class="highlight">What I want from you?</h3>
	<h4>âœ¨Secrecyâœ¨</h4>
	<p>If you got this, that means you are one of the people I can say I trust a little. So I want you to not break that and stfu about this in front of everyone. kthx</p>
	<h3>PS: I welcome every single one of you to roast the f outta me if I'm not able to put a website by 5th of every month.</h3>
