			<h1>October Blog</h1>
			<p>So! This month I used the library p5 to make some basic canvases and sketches. Initially I had planned to make a much more complex game using this, and wasted about 1 week on it, but then I realised that p5 wasn't hardware accelerated and so it worked at literal 0.3 fps, which would definitely not be ideal. So I scratched that and with a very limited lifetime of 4 days made some sketches and animations so that I had something to show here. Enjoy! I'm sorry they suck, I have osteoporosis and severe brain damage.</p>

			<p>I'll be starting with the easiest and slowly move on in difficulty, so for starters there is <i>the background of this page.</i> Don't get me wrong, it's not just random dots on the screen, to see the animation, try holding left click of your mouse anywhere on the sides of the text. This was inspired by the twenty one pilots livestream experience which had a similar animation but in 3D for their song trees. This took roughly 30 mins to make and another 30 to set the values of things so that it looks better.</p>

			<h1>Project 2</h1>
			<p>This is a triangle fractal, one of the most basic fractals in existence. this took me around 5-6 hrs to make cos I don't know how to code. I fucked up only 2 projects where I implemented functional programming and that didn't work, so I OOPed my way out of it. The button is for adding depth, surprisingly, and the slider is for changing the thickness of the lines that will be drawn next. I tried a few more complexer fractals after this one but they didn't work, and so this is the only fractal in this project.</p>

			<h1>Project 3</h1>
			<p>This one is based on the sand falling logic I saw in <a href="https://youtu.be/M39R2A8kuh8" target="_blank">this auctux video</a> and I tried to do it myself, but the depth currently only goes 1 layer. If I had another layer to it, it just adds a million other layers on it's own, I have 0 idea why. So yea, half done, half fucked. Spent around 4-5 hrs on making this, and another 10-12 hrs trying to figure out why tf it doesn't work, adding absolutely nothing to it. But it was still semi-done so here, have it.</p>

			<h1>Project 4</h1>
			<p>So this one's a pretty cool pieace that I made, copying from <a href="https://beesandbombs.com/" target="_blank">Dave Whyte, a.k.a. bees and bombs.</a> But, he is a professional graphics artist or someting and I am not, so mine is way shittier, at times the dots lose track, at times they just mess up, but I, again have no idea why or how. So that was my attempt at copying a legend. The sliders at the bottom are for Speed Constant and Accuracy Constant, which are inverse to their things. You can just refresh the page in case the balls spiral away.</p>

			<h1>Project 5</h1>
			<p>Ok, so this one I actually made before my end sems, and this took like 2-3 days to complete, but again, it fucked up for some reason. When I run it on localhost, it correctly works, but it doesn't work on the web, most of the times. Go ahead, and have a look at it. You try to find a cow, in the darkness, with just a smol circle around your mouse being the light. Click the mouse to get a sound, telling you you're hot or cold.</p>
			<a href="https://find-the-cow.destux.repl.co">Here</a>
			<p>The thing that doesn't work, which you may have noticed is the panning. The sound was supposed to come from the direction of the cow, but it doesn't. I again have no idea why. So I optimised it to show an arrow in the direction. This is one of the projects that doesn't use OOP, just plain old functional.</p>

			<h1>üëèüëè Lib Review üëèüëè</h1>
			<p>p5.js is a very beginer-friendly and easy to use library. It's great for getting people into prgramming, but I don't think it can serve a higher purpose to be honest. I also tried the WEBGL mode, but that's just, NO. three.js is way better in infinitely many ways. I believe the thing that gives p5.js the clear advantage above everything else is the legend, Dan Shiffman being the one who teaches it. Absolutely love all of his videos, and while thinking about ideas for this, I realised he has done alot of them on his channel, and so I had to skip them. Anyways, 1-line review: Easy, but not so fast. </p>
